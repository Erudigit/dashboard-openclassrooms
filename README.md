# Dashboard Sport App

We are introducing our dashboard for SportSee app. This allows you to follow your progression and all the results from your activities. 

Dynamic graphs, scores and everything you need to have a real view of your evolution.

We are trying to keep our best to improve the dashboard, changes can be merged to master.

## Introduction

The dashboard was developped to be the most readiable and comprehensiable. The mains colors we used are the red and black with the SportSee colors.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites



### Install the node server

First of all, we need to launch the server to have our routes and URLs to fetch the data on.




### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

<!--
Use this template as a quick starting point when writing a README for your Pulumi example. To start, copy this file to your example folder and rename it to `README.md`. Once you've reviewed the template, delete the comments and begin writing your accompanying README for your example Pulumi application.

Use GitHub's "Preview Changes" functionality to make sure everything is formatted correctly in Markdown.

Readers should be able to follow your example from beginning to end. Please be sure to list all prerequisites, and test your guide from start to finish. Cut and paste commands from the README into your terminal to make sure there aren't typos or inaccuracies. If you find yourself executing a command that isn't in the README, make sure to add it so the readers end up with a complete tutorial. See [EC2 Linux WebServer Instance](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/tutorials/aws/ec2-webserver/) for an example of a tutorial following this template. Note that the featured tutorial is multi-language whereas the exampleas in this repo are cloud and language-specific (except for the ones with the `cloud` prefix).

## Deploy the App

### Step 1: Create a directory and cd into it

For Pulumi examples, we typically start by creating a directory and changing into it. Then, we create a new Pulumi project from a template. For example, `azure-javascript`.

<!--
If showing a command, explain the command first by talking about what it does. Then show the command and its output. If the output is too long, you can clip it with `...` and only show the relevant parts. If your README includes images, make sure to include an alt text.

Now transition to the next step by telling the reader what's next. If you're adding to a file, make sure to clearly explain that.
